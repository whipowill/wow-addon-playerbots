# PlayerBot Addon

In the WoW private server world there was a guy named [Ike3](http://ike3.github.io/mangosbot-docs/) who wrote a bot script that would create robot players in the game.  You could have hundreds of them, and they would run around and fight and do quests and they would even use the Auction House.  You could party with them, and even better you could bring in your alts and play with them too.  It was amazing.

- The Ike module was originally written for Mangos
- He wrote an [addon](https://github.com/ike3/mangosbot-addon/tree/3.3.5a) package to help the player manage the bots ingame
- Efforts are underway to bring this module to AzerothCore, which is being called the [PlayerBot](https://github.com/ZhengPeiRu21/mod-playerbots) module
- I'm porting Ike's original addon package to make it functional w/ PlayerBot

This addon begins as a fork of Ike's original addon package.
